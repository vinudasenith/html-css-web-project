        <h2 id="profile">User-Profile Page</h2>
        <h3>Technical Description</h3>
        <p>The User Profile Page is provided in HTML format and CSS design with the expectation of being minimalist,
          responsive, and pleasing. It shows critical user information in the nature of a profile image, name, bio, and
          URL contact details. The page falls back to standard HTML tags such as header, section, img, among others, for
          content structuring and display. CSS Flexbox comes into play where the placement happens, border-radius and
          box-shadow for visual, media queries to make it responsive, and hover effects for the interaction. In general,
          there is a beauty, useability, and accessibility balance found within the page.</p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>On the user-profile page, semantic HTML elements such as section tag, h2 tag and p tag helped to ensure
          appropriate content structure, thereby addressing accessibility. Alt text—that is, alt="—"allows screen
          readers to view photos." Clear headlines and link descriptions were provided instead of generic phrases like
          "click here," thereby allowing users to quickly access. Element nesting was maintained such that assistive
          technology could split the page correctly.</p>

      <section>
        <h2 id="contentpage">Content Page</h2>
        <h3>Technical Description</h3>
        <p>The content page of a webpage is structured with HTML elements so that the topics are organized under
          (unordered list) and (ordered list). Within these lists,  (list item) tags describe what each section is.
          Classes (class="") and IDs (id="") are used for styling and navigation, allowing sections to be unique and
          easy to navigate. IDs are for unique elements, and classes are for multiple elements. These elements can be
          styled for readability using CSS. So when you combine these, a properly designed content page enhances
          user experience leading to a better navigation</p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p>In the content page accessibility was covered through the semantic HTML elements like headings (h1, h2, p)
          which give the content a clear structure. To make clear where each link will take the users, descriptive link
          texts were utilized. Information was structured logically with proper list structures: Furthermore, lang="en"
          was added into the tag which helps screen readers make sense of the language and images were given an alt text
          to make sure the content was still available to all visually impaired people..</p>

        <h2 id="sitemap">site map</h2>
        <h3>Technical Description</h3>
        <p>A sitemap is like a visual map of a website’s layout. It’s often made using scalable vector graphics (SVG)
          which makes it easy to adapt to different screen sizes. In a sitemap, you’ll see lines connecting various
          pages to show their hierarchy. Each page is represented by a circle, and you’ll find text labels identifying
          them. By grouping these elements, it’s simpler to style and move everything around. CSS can be used to improve
          the look and feel, making it more interactive. Sitemaps are handy for both users and search engines, helping
          them find their way around a site easily..</p>

        <h3>Accessibility</h3>
        <p> semantic tags were employed such as (nav,svg ,ul ,li) and to structure the site logically. To make the
          targets more understandable to users and screen readers, I provided descriptive link texts. I used appropriate
          heading levels to facilitate navigating. I also kept all interactive elements keyboard accessible and didn't
          use spaces or special characters in file names to allow a seamless access.

      <section>
        <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
        <p>Writing an article on the content page has not been easy for me sometimes due to the nesting of lists. I
          directly put (ul) inside (ol) tags without nesting them inside (li) so it has validation errors. I have to do
          a lot of work in that regard to fully ensure that all the lists are put under <li> elements. Broken links
            along with file paths like images not showing and incorrect file names have given me a hurdle. I checked the
            file locations accurately and wrote the file names relevantly to each file. I found difficulty in giving alt
            text for images to make them more accessible. I have learned through all this that generally happy coding
            gives clear valid HTML, careful path checks, and always keeping accessibility in mind. They helped me to
            make things more detaileding and help make the page seem approachable and professional.</p>

        <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
        <p>The pages that I have produced comply with the JANET guidelines for producing secure, quality pages.


          I ensured the created content was honest, polite and appropriate for everyone. I didn’t use any rude or
          abusive language.


          I used clear headings proper links and simple layout, so people with disabilities (like people using screen
          readers) can also use my pages easily.


          I have not given out any personal or confidential information about myself or any other person, so it is still
          safe and private.

          I rechecked my code to be sure it was correct and did what it was supposed to do. This test helps to avoid
          errors and make sure that everybody can see the page the way it should be..</p>
